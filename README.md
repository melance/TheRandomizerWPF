### What is The Randomizer ###
---
* The Randomizer is the Infinitely Customizeable Random Content Generator.  It was designed with role playing game players and writers in mind though it is far from limited to those folks.
* Using an easy to use but robust and flexible interface you can generate content of almost any sort including *names, descriptions, detailed characters, maps,* and *much more*
* Included with the initial installation are dozens of generators to get you started, however; the true power of The Randomizer is the ability to write your own generators in one of several simple xml layouts or using the built in Grammar Editor.

### How do I get set up? ###
---
There are two ways to set up The Randomizer:

* [A Windows Installer](https://github.com/melance/TheRandomizerWPF/releases/download/2.1.1.0/The.Randomizer.Setup.exe)
* [A Compressed Zip File](https://github.com/melance/TheRandomizerWPF/releases/download/2.1.1.0/The.Randomizer.zip)

Both can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/melance/TheRandomizerWPF/releases) section of this repository

### Community ###
---
There is a small but great community on reddit that I personally moderate under the subreddit [/r/TheRandomizer](http://www.reddit.com/r/therandomizer) to keep up to date on news, new versions, customizations, and more.

### Contributing ###
---
**Everyone**
I love seeing custom grammars and libraries written by users to add to the growing list.  If you develop a new grammar that you think anyone else might like, please submit it to the [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/therandomizer) or send it to me a message here via my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/melance).

**Developers**
I'm always looking for new developers to contribute to the cause.  I have a number of grand ideas on the horizon for the project that can always use help if you are interested.
