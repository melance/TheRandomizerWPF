### What is this repository for? ###

* The Randomizer is the Infinitely Customizeable Random Content Generator.  It was designed with role playing game players and writers in mind though it is far from limited to those folks.

### A note about the source code ###
Presently, the source code is terribly out of date as my familiarity with Git is abysmal and I've been unable to send my changes to the server.  I hope to remedy this in short order but can't make promises.

### How do I get set up? ###
There are two ways to set up The Randomizer:

* Windows Installer: https://bitbucket.org/lanceboudreaux/the-randomizer/downloads/The%20Randomizer%20Setup.exe
* Compressed Zip File: https://bitbucket.org/lanceboudreaux/the-randomizer/downloads/The%20Randomizer.zip

### Community ###
There is a great community on reddit under the subreddit [/r/TheRandomizer](http://www.reddit.com/r/therandomizer) to keep up to date on news, new versions, customizations, and more.
