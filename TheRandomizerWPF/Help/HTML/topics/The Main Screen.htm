		  the type of generation you want to occur, how many times, and more then press 
		  Generate to see the magic. Below is a break down of each section of the screen 
		  including it's purpose, and how to use it.
		</p>
		<p>

			1 The Title Bar
		</p>
		<p>
		  Aside from the standard title bar icon and controls The Randomizer has the
		  following special commands:
		  <ul class="shr">
			<li><b>Settings</b>: The application Settings are indicated by a small gear 
			icon in the window title bar.  Clicking on the icon will open the settings 
			flyout allowing you to change things such as the window theme, the default 
			font for results, if the application checks for new versions when launched, 
			and more.</li>
			<li><b>Help</b>: A small question mark icon located in the window title bar
			launches this help documentation.</li>
			<li><b>About</b>: Clicking on the lower case "i" contained in a circle
			found in the window title bar will display information about the application
			including the version, change log, copyright, and more.</li> 
		  </ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		<p class="big">
			2 The Menu 
		</p>
		<p>
		  <ul class="shr">
			<li><b>Tools</b>
			  <ul class="shr">
				<li><b>Grammar Editor</b>: The Grammar Editor is a graphical user interface
				tool used to define generator grammars in a manner that is more friendly
				than using a text editor.</li>
				<li><b>Markov Chain Generator</b>: The Markov Chain Generator is one 
				method of creating a grammar based upon a collection of existing words 
				or names.</li>
				<li><b>Phonotactics Generator</b>: The phonotactics generator takes 
				two files, one a sample file and the other a definition file and 
				generates a phonotactic grammar file.</li>
				<li><b>Item List Converter</b>: This tool will take a text file with a
				list of items, one per line, and create a grammar or library from the 
				list.  This is useful for times when it is desired to have a simple
				generator that selects an item from a list of items.</li>
				<li><b>Refresh Grammars</b>: Clicking this menu item will refresh the
				generator list.</li>
			  </ul>
			</li>

		<p class="big">
			3 The Tag Bar
		</p>
		<p>
		  The tag bar contains a list of all of the tags currently defined in the loaded
		  grammar files.  The generator listing is filtered by selecting the tags you would
		  like to see or hide.  Only generators containing at least one of the selected
		  tags will appear in the list.  By default, all tags are selected when launching the
		  application.
		</p>
		<p>  
		  Clicking on the buttons on the left of the tags that resemble a checkbox, 
		  will either toggle all tags off or on depending upon the button clicked.  
		</p>
		<p>
		  The tag bar can be hidden
		  by clicking the chevron icon next to the header.
		</p>
		<br>

		<p class="big">
			4 The Generator List
		</p>
		<p>
		  Below the <b>Generators</b> header is the list of currently available generators.
		  This list can be changed by adding new grammar files to the grammars folder
		  or by selecting and deselecting tags in the <b>Tag Bar</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Selecting a generator from the list will cause the application to use that
		  geneartor as the current generator for populating the details in the <b>Details</b> 
		  area and choosing the options such as <b>Parameters</b> and <b>Max Length</b>. 
		</p>
		<br>

		<p class="big">
		  5 The Detail Area
		</p>
		<p>
		  The detail area is broken into 5 areas:
		</p>
		<p>
		  <ul class="shr">
			<li><b>Grammar Details:</b> This area presents the details of the selected
			grammar including the description, author, file location, tags, etc.</li>
			<li><b>Parmeters:</b> The parameter list only appears if a particular grammar
			requires parameter input.  Otherwise the area does not show at all.</li>
			<li><b>Max Length:</b> If supported by the selected grammar, this numeric box
			sets the maximum length a single result may be.</li>
			<li><b>Repeat:</b> This numeric box determines the number of results to request
			from the generator.</li>
			<li><b>Actions:</b> The last area of the <b>Detail Area</b> is the actions
			area that contains the <b>Generate</b> and <b>Cancel</b> buttons.  Clicking the <b>Generate</b>
			button begins the content generation process.  While the process is running,
			the <b>Generate</b> button becomes a <b>Cancel</b> button that can stop the generation process
			prematurely.
		  </ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p class="big">
			6 The Results Panel
		</p>
		<p>
			All generation results and actions that can be taken on them are located here.
		</p>
		<p>
			<ul class="shr">
				<li><b>Result Tabs:</b> When generating results, the results are applied to the currently
				selected tab.</li>
				<li><b>Actions:</b> At the bottom of the results area are the result actions.  These include:
