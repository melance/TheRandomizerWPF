<H5>HHC4012: The string "name of string" in line "line number" of the file "file name" has not been mapped to a number.</H5>

<P><B>Problem:</B> The compiler is processing a text file in a [TEXT POPUPS] section. Either a topic id in the file (mapped it) is missing entirely (nothing is between the first two quotes) or you have specified an id that has not been mapped to a number.</P>

<P><B>Result:</B> The topic id will be mapped to the number zero.</P>

<P><B>Solution:</B> The topic id should be specified in a header (.h) file. In some programming languages, such as C++, this header file is supplied by your programmers since they must use it to tell HTML Help which topic to display. With other programming languages, you can generate the header file manually or with your help authoring tool.</P>
