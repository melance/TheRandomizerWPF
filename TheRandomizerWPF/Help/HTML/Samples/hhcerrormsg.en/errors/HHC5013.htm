<H5>HHC5013: TOC Error: URL reference cannot be resolved "filename"</H5>

<P><B>Problem:</B> The compiler was unable to create a URL for an entry in the HHC file. This problem may occur if the compiler cannot locate a file referenced in the HHC.</P>

<P><B>Result:</B> The .chm file is corrupt and cannot be used.</P>

<P><B>Solution:</B> This error often occurs when creating a binary TOC. If you do not have a specific reason for using a binary TOC, then turn the option off in your project file. Otherwise, you will need to change the URL. If the binary TOC option is already switched off, the problem is probably the result of the compiler being unable to locate a page reference by the HHC. You will need to identify the file and move it to the intended location. As a best practice to avoid this problem, be sure to explicitly add all project files to the project, rather than relying on the compiler to pull in the files by reference.</P>
