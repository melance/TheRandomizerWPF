<H5>HHC5001: An error occurred while reading "filename".</H5>

<P><B>Problem:</B> The compiler was unable to completely read the file.</P>

<P><B>Result:</B> The .chm file is corrupt and should not be used.</P>

<P><B>Solution:</B> This error is usually caused either by a corrupt hard disk or the inability to read a file from the project on a network drive because the network is down. If the file is on your hard disk, run ScanDisk to check your hard drive. If the file is on a network, check to see that the network is up, and if it is, contact your network administrator to find out why the file cannot be read.</P>
