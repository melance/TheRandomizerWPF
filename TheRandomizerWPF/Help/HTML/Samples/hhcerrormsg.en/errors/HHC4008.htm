<H5>HHC4008: The file "filename" in the [Text Popup] section does not have an extension.</H5>

<P><B>Problem:</B> The compiler expects all files in the [TEXT POPUPS] section to have an extension, but encountered a file that did not have an extension.</P>

<P><B>Result:</B> The file will be ignored. If a program tries to access this file in the .chm file, it will fail.</P>

<P><B>Solution:</B> Add an extension to the file, and change the name in the [TEXT POPUPS] section to include that extension.</P>

<table>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="InfoBackground"><P><B>Note:</B> We were not able to get the compiler to generate this error. Instead, if the file was missing an extension, it would be silently ignored. You should always use extensions for any files in the [TEXT POPUPS] section if even you don't get the warning message.</P></td>
