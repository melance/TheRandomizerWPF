      With help of this navigation panel and appropriate <a href="pageFiles.htm">Included files page</a>, you can edit the list of all files explicitly included in your resulting help.
    </p>
    <img src="../img/ss_files.jpg" class="ssright"/>
    <p>
	   Generally it is recommended to place all used project files in this list (except the <i>HHP</i> project file and the resulting <i>CHM</i> file),
     since the help compiler (for the CHM format) is not able to recognize (in some cases) all the files referenced from your topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The navigation panel provides various options for <b>filtering</b> the file list and the page offers actions for adding, deleting and other modifications of this list
      (including file preview possibility].
    </p>
    <p>
      The detailed description of the <b>included files page</b> possibilities can be found <a href="pageFiles.htm">here</a>.

        Panel is divided into two sections. In the <b>Views</b> section, you can find the <i>filter types</i>, that can be applied on the file list.
        The selected filter type options are displayed in the <b>second panel section</b>.</li>
      <li><a href="pageFiles.htm">The file list</a> can be also filtered by text, and this is done via the <i>Search</i> field (in the top right corner of the page).</li>
    </ul>

      Filter types overview
    </p>
    <ul class="shr">
      <li><b>Folders</b> - filter items are the folders of your project directory structure (folders are displayed in the same manner as you created them on the disk)</li>
      <li><b>Quick folders</b> - filter items are the folders of your project files, but arranged in the single level list</li>
      <li><b>File types</b> -  filter items are most commonly used file types when creating a help project (so, files in the list are filtered by the type - resp. its extensions)</li>
    </ul>
