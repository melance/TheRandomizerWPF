      The context-sensitive help editor <b>gives you the full control</b> over assigning context IDs, alias IDs, source files and commentaries.
      Possibility to work in <b>simple mode</b> is advantageous for users who do not want to deal with detailed definitions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This editor allows you to also enter so-called <b>text popups</b>, a visual <b>indication of duplicities</b>
      and last but not least copying and pasting the selected items to and from the clipboard (for easy collaboration with other applications).
    </p>
    <p>
      Context help navigation panel is used for <b>filtering the items</b>, selecting the working mode and for setting an additional editor parameters.
	    It also allows the <b>batch assignment</b> of context identifiers to all help topics.<br>
      It is divided into three sections - <b>Topics filter</b>, <b>Identifiers filter</b> and <b>Other options</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Editor itself is located on the <a href="pageMap.htm">Context help page</a>,
      that shows the table of topics, context help identifiers, source files and comments.
      All editing and assignment can be performed directly in this table, so the creation of context-sensitive help in the Precision Helper is similar to the work in spreadsheet editor.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <i>Note:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table of context-sensitive help identifiers is automatically <b>pre-filled with all topics</b> defined anywhere in the project.
      You do not have to manualy add or remove topics, but only assign the identifiers.
      Saved are only the rows of context-sensitive help table, having completed the necessary data.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The context help editor options description is provided <a href="pageMap.htm">here</a>.

    <ul class="shr">
      <li style="list-style-type:none"><i>Topics filter:</i></li>
      <li><b>Content topics</b> - displays topics from <a href="navBar_TOC.htm">table of contents</a></li>
      <li><b>Index topics</b> - displays topics from <a href="navBar_IDX.htm">index of keywords</a></li>
      <li><b>Files topics</b> - displays topics from <a href="navBar_Files.htm">included files list</a></li>
      <li><b>Other topics</b> - displays all other topics, that does not meet the previous conditions</li>
      <li><b>Text popups</b> - displays text popups</li>

      <li style="list-style-type:none"></li>
      <li style="list-style-type:none"><i>Identifiers filter:</i></li>
      <li><b>Duplicit IDs</b> - displays only rows, that have duplicated context or symbolic identifier</li>
      <li><b>No context IDs</b> - displays only rows without context identifier</li>
      <li><b>No symbolic IDs</b> - displays only rows without symbolic identifier</li>
      <li><b>Comments</b> - displays only rows with comments</li>
      
      <li style="list-style-type:none"></li>
      <li style="list-style-type:none"><i>Other options:</i></li>
      <li><b>Mark duplicit items</b> - a useful option, that helps with finding duplicities in the table.
          Cells with duplicate identifiers will be marked with a red tilde (see also "Identifiers filter - Duplicit IDs" above)</li>
      <li><b>Automatically assign IDs</b> - if you do not want to assign identifiers automatically in the batch process (see the "Assign identifiers" below),
          but you would appreciate some form of automation of this activity, you can use this option.
          It allows to assign identifiers (and their sources) automatically only for the table row that is currently editing.
          So, by pressing the SPACEBAR and then the ENTER key (on any other column then the first) you can get the automatically assigned context-sensitive help definition for currently selected row.</li>
      <li><b>Show advanced columns</b> - this is the option to setup a <b>working mode</b>. If it is checked, you have the full control over the definition
          (you see and can edit the topics, identifiers, sources and comments).
          If it is unchecked, you see and can edit only two of most important columns (topic and the context identifier)
          and the rest of the definition is generated automatically (regardless of the option "Automatically assign IDs").</li>
      <li style="list-style-type:none"></li>
      <li><b>Show all items ...</b> - this action will turn on all the filters in <i>Topics filter</i> and <i>Identifiers filter</i> sections (see above)</li>
      <li><a name="assignids"></a> <b>Assign identifiers ...</b> - this action will perform a batch assignment of identifiers (only cells without the definition are filled).
          Also when the editor page is closing, it performs some checks, so you will be informed about the bad or missing definition.</li>
    </ul>

      <b>Used terminology</b>
    </p>
    <ul class="shr">
      <li><i>context identifier</i> - integer identifier (also known as "MAP ID" or "HelpContext") that is used to link the application and the help.
          Help for the topic (with context identifier assigned) can be displayed directly from your application
          (your development tool must support the help and application linking - see also <a href="toolsAPITester.htm">API Tester</a>).</li>
      <li><i>symbolic identifier</i> - symbolic name (an alfanumeric identifier also known as "ALIAS ID") that is used as an interface between the context identifier
          and the topic if necessary (ie. when the topic file has the spaces in his name, etc.)</li>
      <li><i>source file</i> - this means the physical storage of context or symbolic identifier. Identifiers can be stored directly in the project file,
          or in the separate so-called "header" files (see also <a href="dialogOptions.htm#hhc">Options - External tools - MS Html Help</a>).</li>
      <li><i>text popup</i> - text popups are short descriptions, that are displayed to the end user when he hover the mouse over some application element.
          These items of context-sensitive help are always stored separately from project file, so they always have assigned the source files (resp. at least the symbolic ID source file).</li>
