    <p>
    	In the list of merged files you define the <b>external help files</b> (CHM format),
    	that you want to be also available when the user browses your help.
    	It means that the <a href="navBar_IDX.htm">index of keywords</a>, the <a href="pageProject.htm">fulltext search index</a>,
      and (when specified) the <a href="navBar_TOC.htm">table of contents</a> can be viewed by the user as it is a part of your help project.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you want to include the table of contents of external help into your contents, you have to define an appropriate item in your <a href="navBar_TOC.htm">table of contents</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
	    The advantage of such definition is that the help files (including yours) are compiling separately and can be distributed separately, one without the other.
    </p>
    <p>
	    But keep in mind that if you want to use informations from the external help, it must be included in the distribution of your help files.
    </p>

    <p>
    	The list of merged files is accessible through the <a href="navBar_Others.htm">Settings</a> navigation panel.
