      With help of this navigation panel, the Precision Helper can define and store lists of projects selected for <b>batch compilation</b>.
    </p>
    <img src="../img/ss_builds.jpg" class="ssright"/>
    <p>
      This application area is intended primarily for those users, who do not work in a more integrated company environment
      and who do not use one of the tools for task automation, compilation and distribution.<br>
      Nevertheless, even in such an environment may be this part of Precision Helper useful, for example,
      if you want to only compile a help projects of the complex product.

    </p>
    <ul class="shr">
      <li>
        <b>Predefined</b> and <b>stored</b> builds are available in this navigation panel.
        By selecting the desired item (a build) you open the appropriate <a href="pageBuilds.htm">editor page</a> with the list of projects used for this batch compilation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Application offers two predefined builds - <b>All projects</b> and <b>Recently opened</b>.
        As their names suggest, these are the projects in your <a href="ProjectsList.htm">projects list</a>, respectively the projects that was recently opened.
      </li>
      <li>
      	User defined (stored) builds are sorted in alphabetical order. A small info about the number of included projects is displayed right to the item.
      </li>
      <li>
	      You can <b>rename</b> or <b>delete</b> the stored build via the popup menu of the navigation panel.
        Of course, the "Remove" action does not delete the projects (neither the files, nor the project items from your <a href="ProjectsList.htm">projects list</a>),
        but it is intended to remove user defined build only.
      </li>
      <li>
        More informations about the build editor can be found in the <a href="pageBuilds.htm">Build (editor)</a> help topic.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <i>Note:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you get in a situation where you can see the navigation panel, but any <a href="pageBuilds.htm">appropriate page</a> (list) is not visible,
      simply click the mouse on any item of navigation panel (or press the ENTER key if the panel is focused) and the page with a build item will be opened.
      If you want to open an editor for already selected build item, you have to use a double-click on it (or you have to press the ENTER key, if the navigation panel is focused).</i>
