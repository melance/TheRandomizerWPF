      This wizard fills in the <a href="navBar_TOC.htm">table of contents</a> with topics from selected source (folder, list, etc.).
      This is usefull, when you already have some topic files and you want to add them into the contents at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, only topics that are not already included, are inserted into the contents.

      <li><b>Topics from selected folder</b> - topic files are inserted from the folder you select (including subfolders)</li>
