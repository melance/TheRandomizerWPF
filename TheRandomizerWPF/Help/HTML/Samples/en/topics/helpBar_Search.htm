    <p>
      This tab of <a href="helpBar.htm">the properties panel</a> is designed for <b>global searching</b>
      in all the project and application areas including the topic file texts.
    </p>
    <img src="../img/ss_search.jpg" class="ssright"/>
    <p>
      Enter <b>search text</b> in the appropriate field at the top of the tab and press the ENTER key (or click the <b>Search</b> button).
      Application will find the text in all the selected <b>areas</b> and displays the results in the <b>list of search results</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to obtain more specific results, you can enter more words separated by spaces - the application will search only those items (topics, words, projects, etc.)
      containing all the words.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Selection of the search areas is realized by the drop down menu of the "Search" button.<br>
      The application searches the currently open project, <a href="ProjectsList.htm">the projects list</a> and a <a href="navBar_Builds.htm">builds list</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
	    At the bottom of the tab is displayed an information about the number of results found.<br>
      The "<b>Sort results</b>" button can be used to sort the search results in <i>ascending</i> or <i>descending</i> order
      and it can be used to group the results by the search areas.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Viewing of the selected item</b> (navigation) is realized by simply clicking on it (or by selecting it by arrow keys and pressing the ENTER key).
      Application opens the <a href="navBar.htm">navigation panel</a>, <a href="tabBar.htm">the page</a>, the tab, or other place where the item is found, and there the item is focused.
    </p>

      Searching and the Quick launch possibilities
    </p>
    <ul class="shr">
      <li>Any of the search result item can be dragged onto one of the <a href="HomePage.htm">Quick launch</a> buttons on the <b>welcome page</b>.</li>
      <li>By clicking the quick launch button you can then be navigated to desired item anytime later.
          And this is done even if the project, that the item belongs to, is not opened
          (in this case the actual project will be closed - of course with asking you to save your work - then the desired project will be open and the navigation to the item will be realized).</li>
