    <p>
      This dialog is (starting from version 2.0) used also for <b>selecting the topic templates</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dialog contains <b>list of files</b> (intended to the selected place), a field for <b>quick file searching</b> (resp. filtering by the text),
      a <b>file type filtering</b> panel and the <b>places bar</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filtering by file type could be combined, if the SHIFT key is pressed during clicking the buttons (or pressing the SPACE key).
    </p>
    <p>
      Dialog is always open in the <i>place</i>, that corresponds to the context and situation from which it is called.
