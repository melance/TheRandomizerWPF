    <p>
      This wizard <b>decompiles</b> the selected <b>CHM</b> (<i>Microsoft Compiled Html Help</i>) file archive
      into the specified folder and creates a new help project in <b>HHP</b> (<i>Microsoft Html Help Project</i>) format.
    </p>
    <p>
      The required input parameters are only the path to CHM file and the file name (including path) of newly generated project.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, in the wizard dialog select th CHM file, filename of new project and click on "Next &gt;" to start this action.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      <b>We strongly recommend</b> to generate a new project in EMPTY folder. In the other way, you risk an incorrect
      results in newly created project definition (the old files in selected folder may be included in new definition).<br>
      Similar recommendation is also relevant for the location of decompiled CHM file - for a new project always use a different folder
      than this, where decompiled CHM file is located.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, if you are repeatedly testing a decompilation of the same CHM file, you can leave the source (CHM) and destination (a new project) parameters of the wizard as they are.
