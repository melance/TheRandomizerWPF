      Here is the list of news, changes, implemented ideas and bug fixes for each of the product version.
    </p>

    <p class="big" style="padding-top:8px;">
      Version 2.0&nbsp;&nbsp;<font style="font-weight:normal">(27.4.2011)</font>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>added: Embedded editor of topics, including the syntax highlighting, code completion, text and code insertion via predefined keystrokes, and including the support for using extensions/add-ons (see bellow).
                 All these features are customizable by defining and selecting your own syntax schemes.</li>
      <li>added: Topic templates. Any topic can be saved and used as a template (including an automatic detection of used styles, images, scripts, etc.)</li>
      <li>added: Project templates. Any project, including the topics, images, and other files, can be defined and used as a template.</li>
      <li>added: Application extensions (Add-Ons). Precision Helper can be extended by user defined add-ons. A command-line and Pascal Script interfaces (including the GUI) are supported.</li>
      <li>added: The first extensions are available, such as HTML Tidy, Project statistics, Edit TOC and Index in an external editor, Wizard to create a new project from existing topic files, and more.</li>
      <li>added: Now build lists can contain also other formats of compilation (export), such as WebHelp, SingleHTML, etc.</li>
      <li>added: Option to automatically add all used files into an "Included files list" (on project save)</li>
      <li>added: WebHelp templates, that consist of navigation frames, now contain the ability to directly navigate to desired topic.
                 So you can refer to a topic in this kind of help format, by using the simple url syntax like "c:\WebHelp\index.htm#mytopic.htm" or "http://www.mysite.com/WebHelp/index.php#mytopic.htm", etc.</li>
      <li>added: Auto refresh of topic preview when editing in an external editor (after the user switches back to Precision Helper)</li>
      <li>added: Function for exploring the folder of selected file (in Files/Projects/Builds lists) now supports customizable file manager option</li>
      <li>added: Edit button for referenced TOC (in topic page window)</li>
      <li>added: New GUI color schemes (Windows 7, Office 2010, etc.)</li>
      <li>added: "ExtraSeparators" template for WebHelp export (to support languages like Chinese, Japanese, etc.)</li>
      <li>added: "New window" button for opening a new instance of Precision Helper (in main menu)</li>      
      <li>improved: Last selected templates and targets for export (publishing) are now retained for each project apart</li>
      <li>improved: WebHelp format now supports topic titles that include apostrophes</li>
      <li>improved: WebHelp search feature has been improved, so the whole online help can work as embedded into an IFRAME now</li>
      <li>improved: WebHelp search feature now supports words (expressions) with apostrophes</li>
      <li>improved: Correct handling of files stored in UTF8 encoding, without preamble. The problems were noticeable especially when exporting into WebHelp.
                    Precision Helper now supports both these forms of UTF8 files (whether it is a configuration file, template file, topic, etc.).</li>
      <li>improved: Bookmarks (internal links) inside the SingleHTML help are defined now as &lt;A name="#..."&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
                    (without the end tag, the links have been displayed incorrectly in some browsers, eg Firefox and Opera)</li>
      <li>improved: In project file selection dialog now you can switch between available places by pressing the Alt+Up or Alt+Down hot-keys</li>                    
      <li>fixed: AutoSync feature in a WebHelp has been fixed for use in Internet Explorer, where the addresses encoded in MIME/URL did not work</li>
      <li>fixed: AutoSync feature in a WebHelp now correctly navigates to topics with the same names, but located in other branches of TOC</li>
      <li>fixed: Application modal dialogs have been dedicated to show strictly in the current desktop (to support dual monitors usage)</li>
      <li>fixed: Error on adding the first keyword for topic (in the quick add keyword panel), that appears in some specific situations (eg when the index of keywords was empty)</li>
      <li>fixed: If you have cleared all the context help IDs, Precision Helper did not clear an appropriate sections (MAP and ALIAS)
                 in the project file. This has been fixed.</li>
    </ul>

              (this behaviour is supported now, but generally we do not recommend to use this kind of links in TOC and INDEX)</li>
    </ul>

                     (before this improvement, the links were decompiled as they were stored in the CHM, with the possible unwanted difference between TOC/INDEX and the FILES section)</li>
      <li>fixed:    CHM Import - context IDs are now recovered also for the situation when the IDs were stored in the project file (.hhp)</li>

      <li>added: The VirtualTreeview.chm help file was included into the Samples folder, to show the decompiling possibilities on the independent project.
                  Many thanks to VirtualTreeview component author for cooperation (Mike Lischke, Soft-Gems, see <a href="Credits.htm">Credits</a>).<br>
                   <i>Note: the decompiled help project cannot be compiled with hhc.exe compiler with unchecked "Show compilation progress" option on some machines (use the default hha.dll compiler instead).
                    When you check the mentioned option, everything works well also for hhc.exe compiler.</i>
